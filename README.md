git clone <your-repo-url>
cd deepfake-detection-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=Deepfake Detection App
```

### 4. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

npm start
```

## üîí Security Considerations

- API keys are handled securely and never stored in localStorage
- File uploads are validated for type and size
- All API communications use HTTPS
- Input validation and sanitization implemented
- Rate limiting recommended for production use

## üìä API Integration

The application integrates with DeepAI's API for deepfake detection:

- **Real-time Detection**: Fast analysis of images and videos
- **Free Tier**: 5,000 API calls per month included
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- **Response Parsing**: Proper parsing of DeepAI API responses

## üé® Customization

### Styling

The app uses Tailwind CSS with custom components. Key customization points:

```css
/* Custom colors in tailwind.config.js */
colors: {
  primary: { /* Your brand colors */ },
  success: { /* Success state colors */ },
  danger: { /* Error state colors */ }
}
```

### Components

All components are modular and can be easily customized:

- `FileUpload.tsx`: File upload interface
- `DetectionResult.tsx`: Results display
- `LoadingSpinner.tsx`: Loading states
- `deepai-api.ts`: API integration logic
